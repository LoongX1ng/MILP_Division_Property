### Algorithm 2

- This folder contains the Python code to calculate the division trails of a given sbox, and the division trails will be stored in cipher_DivisionTrails.txt.
- 此文件夹包含计算一个给定S盒的可分轨迹的Python代码，可分轨迹存储在cipher_DivisionTrails.txt里。
- This code takes the PRESENT Sbox as an example and calculates its division trails. You can replace the sbox specification in main.py with any other Sbox to calculate its division trails.
- 此代码以PRESENT的S盒为例，计算它的可分轨迹。可在main.py中修改为S盒以计算其可分轨迹。
